### 1. What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?

I chose the movie **"The Tree of Life"** directed by Terrence Malick. The film is a philosophical exploration of life, death, and the universe, juxtaposing the personal journey of a family in Texas with grand, cosmic visuals. The story reflects on themes of love, loss, the origins of life, and the connection between all living things.

### 2. What aspect of the movie will you include in your cover?

The poster will focus on **the symbolic tree** that represents life, growth, and interconnectedness. It will feature the tree growing dynamically, surrounded by a cosmic background filled with twinkling stars. The poster will also incorporate the changing of seasons to reflect life’s cycles—birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.

### 3. Is it interactive? Time-based? Both?

The poster will be **both interactive and time-based**:
- **Interactive**: The tree’s branching angle can be controlled by the user via a slider, allowing the user to manipulate how the tree grows and shapes itself.
- **Time-Based**: The poster will simulate the passage of time by changing the seasons every few seconds. 

### 4. What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?

I would like to explore the **cyclic nature of life** through the dynamic growth of the tree, and how it visually reflects the passage of time and seasons. The interaction via the slider will allow users to actively shape the tree, symbolizing the choices and changes people experience in life. I’d also like to experiment with the **contrast between personal growth (the tree) and the vastness of the universe (the cosmic stars)**.

### 5. Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?

The project reflects some of the conceptual ideas from **Yoko Ono’s "Grapefruit"**, focusing on minimalist visual storytelling and the passage of time.
