Initialize canvas and set up slider for branch angle

Setup():
    - Create canvas and initialize slider for branch angle (0 to TWO_PI)
    - Initialize season variables and set duration for seasonal change (10 seconds)
    - Create arrays for leaves and stars
    - Populate arrays:
        - Create multiple Star objects with random positions
        - Create empty Leaf array to be filled during spring and summer seasons

Draw():
    - Clear background
    - Calculate current season based on elapsed time using modulus on millis() function
    - Set background color based on season:
        - Spring: light blue
        - Summer: green
        - Fall: orange
        - Winter: gray

    - Draw stars
        - For each star in stars array, call twinkle() method to adjust brightness
    
    - Check slider value to update branch angle
    - Draw the tree
        - Translate to canvas bottom center
        - Call branch() method with initial length (100), recursively generating branches with the current slider angle

    - Handle leaves based on season:
        - If season is Spring or Summer:
            - Add leaves to tree (grow new leaves)
            - For each leaf, call display() method to render on canvas
        - If season is Fall:
            - For each leaf, call fall() method to make leaves fall downwards
            - Render leaves with display()
        - If season is Winter:
            - Remove leaves from tree (bare branches)
            - Display reflective quote on canvas

Classes:
    - Tree Class:
        - Constructor: Define position, angle, branch length, and branching depth
        - branch(len): Recursive function that draws branches based on length and slider angle
            - If length > threshold, draw line representing branch
            - Call branch() recursively to draw child branches with updated angles

    - Leaf Class:
        - Constructor: Initialize position and falling speed
        - fall(): Increase leafâ€™s Y position by falling speed (simulate falling)
        - display(): Render leaf as ellipse with specific color (green in spring/summer, red/orange in fall)

    - Star Class:
        - Constructor: Set random position and size for twinkling effect
        - twinkle(): Randomly change brightness of star each frame

Functions:
    - changeSeason():
        - Calculate season based on time using modulus of millis()
        - Update background color and set leaf behaviors based on current season

    - displayQuote():
        - Render a reflective quote in the center of the canvas during winter season

Interactivity:
    - Slider Control:
        - Update branch angle based on slider value
        - Adjust tree growth pattern interactively in real-time

Time-Based Logic:
    - Calculate elapsed time for seasonal changes every 10 seconds:
        - Spring: Tree blooms, leaves grow
        - Summer: Full foliage
        - Fall: Leaves fall from tree
        - Winter: Bare tree with quote displayed
